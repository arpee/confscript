This script is in development and only shows the basics of how it should work.

Use run ./setup from the directory. 
For evey file in the directory a backup will be made of the hidden file of the same name in the root of your home.
Each will then be replaced with a symlink to the confscript directory.

This enables simple git management of your environmental variables, bash setting etc.
